## Project Reflection & Case Study

### Reflection
Building Tulflix helped me master modern web development concepts, including responsive design, modal interactions, and user experience best practices. I learned how to handle missing assets gracefully and how to create a polished, professional UI. The project challenged me to think about accessibility and cross-device compatibility, and I'm proud of the seamless, Netflix-like experience I achieved.

### Case Study / Project Summary
Tulflix is a web-based movie trailer showcase inspired by Netflix. The landing page invites users to sign in, while the home page displays a grid of movies with real posters and interactive "Play Trailer" buttons. Clicking a poster or button opens a modal video player, delivering an immersive preview experience. The site is fully responsive and accessible, with clear navigation and error handling for missing images or videos. This project demonstrates my ability to deliver a professional, user-focused web application.
